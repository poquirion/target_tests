The execution of the following jobs have failed :

    networks_cambridge100 ; networks_cambridge100bis ; 

More infos can be found in the individual log files. Use the following command to display these logs :

    psom_pipeline_visu('/niak/targets/result/demoniak_glm_fir/logs/','log',JOB_NAME)

The following jobs have not been processed due to a dependence on a failed job or the interruption of the pipeline manager :

    fir_subject1a ; fir_subject1b ; fir_subject1c ; fir_subject1d ; fir_subject2a ; fir_subject2b ; fir_subject2c ; fir_subject2d ; glm_avg_fir ; glm_sub1_m_sub2 ; permutation_avg_fir_batch_1 ; permutation_sub1_m_sub2_batch_1 ; permutation_avg_fir_batch_2 ; permutation_sub1_m_sub2_batch_2 ; summary_findings ; test_glm_fir_demoniak ; 

All jobs have been processed, but some jobs have failed.
You may want to restart the pipeline latter if you managed to fix the problems.
