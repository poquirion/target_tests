MNI ICBM152 non-linear 40th generation symmetric and asymmetric Average Brain
                     Stereotaxic Registration Model
                                  2009

This is a very partial version of the ICBM Average Brain, resampled at 5 mm to run very fast tests - an average of 152
T1-weighted MRI scans, linearly and non-linearly (40 iterations)
transformed to form symmetric and asymmetric models in Talairach 
space - that is specially adapted for use with the MNI Linear 
Registration Package (mni_autoreg). 
Please see http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/HomePage for the full version of the package.

Please note that the volumes here are different from the mni305 model
(average_305) that was originally (back in ancient times) included
with mni_autoreg.

Included in this package are the following files:

  mni_icbm152_{t1,t2,pd,gm,wm,csf,cls}_tal_nlin_sym_09a[_{mask,mask_eroded5mm,mask_dilated5mm,pure_wm_2mm}_5mm,wm].mnc.gz

where 

  t1 - T1w modality [0,100]

  sym - symmetric version of the model

  mask - brain mask, it is the same for all modalities but only file for 
         T1w exists [0;1]

All volumes are sampled with 5mm cubic voxels.
